// Need to determine best find by keyword request, and how to organize keywords. Cory wants a search function. I think a cloud would be more practical. We'll also need to somehow pass requests from the HTML to the CRUD on the backend, and I'm not entirely sure how we'd do that, though I don't think it'll be that different from SQL.

// Of rather more importance to me is how we make sure unauthorized parties don't edit or delete information for fun. It's a problem we considered on my last project, but without much success. If the goal here is to be helpful, then we have no choice but to be fastidious with maintenance. The idea of giving every user unrestricted access to my database gives me the shivers.

// As to the keyword issue, we'll build a keyword database that's associated with the scholarship database. Each scholarship could have many keywords. I would prefer to provide a list of keywords for users to choose from, but I think I can standardize user input in the front end, removing some of the concerns. I would much prefer to know that the scholarship CRUD functions are working before we do that, so it's moot. That's our next goal.
